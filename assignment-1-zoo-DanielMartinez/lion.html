		The lion is a majestic carnivorous mammal belonging to the Felidae family and is known for its distinctive appearance, with a muscular body, rounded head, and a prominent mane in males. Lions are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa and a small population exists in the Gir Forest of India. They are highly social animals, living in prides consisting of related females, their offspring, and a coalition of one or more males. Lions are apex predators and skilled hunters, preying on a variety of large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are known for their powerful roar, which serves as a means of communication within the pride and as a territorial display. Lions are iconic symbols of strength, courage, and royalty, often featured prominently in folklore, mythology, and heraldry.
